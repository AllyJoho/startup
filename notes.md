## Setup
Setup is kinda easy. I'm sure time will get rid of this stress but I feel like I have too many repositories open.\
Also I have no idea what's going on with AWS. They have my credit card so I have no choice but to trust them. I'm just going to trust and vibe.

## HTML
So I got behind in my work and now I'm worried about the commits spread out over multiple days. I'm going to do my best to show proper ownership but I'm a little overwhelmed because shool is just a lot sometimes.\
I understand HTML itself really well so I'm not too worried about it, but I am really bad at doing things on time.\
I pulled free icons from Chanut-is-Industries, which is a free to use platform. This consists of the image used in friends and games for the trophy.
I did design the favicon myself with google drawing though.
