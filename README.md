# Your startup name here

[My Notes](notes.md)

This is my startup for my CS 260 class. The actual application is a scorekeeper app for multiple people at once.

## ðŸš€ Specification Deliverable

For this deliverable I did the following. I checked the box `[x]` and added a description for things I completed.

- [x] Proper use of Markdown
- [x] A concise and compelling elevator pitch
- [x] Description of key features
- [x] Description of how you will use each technology
- [x] One or more rough sketches of your application. Images must be embedded in this file using Markdown image references.

### Elevator pitch

Have you ever played a game and you always want to check the score but someone else is writing it? Is the scorekeeper slow? Are they bad at their job? Is it no oneâ€™s fault but the fact you guys are playing long distance? Well hereâ€™s the solution! Everyone has an account for their score keeping that connects and displays everyoneâ€™s score, and everyone is responsible for handling their own business. Everyone can constantly watch how much theyâ€™re winning or losing however much they want. You will never have to guess the score again!

### Key features

- Login and and connect with friends
- Make updates to your score
- Automatically ranks scores
- Can come back to games later

### Technologies

I am going to use the required technologies in the following ways.

- **HTML** - Uses correct HTML stucture for application. There will be a page for logging in, creating a game, and adding friends.
- **CSS** - CSS will make the application visually pleasing and accessible to a wide range of users.
- **React** - Provides login display, the ranking of the players, applying score changes, and makes endpoint calls. Reacts to user imput.
- **Service** - Backend server functionality for the following:
    - Retreiving scores
    - Submitting score change
    - Will use [agify.io](https://agify.io/) to have a guss of the users age associated with their account purely to be funny.
    - Register, login, and logout users. Credentials securely stored in database.
    - Connecting to other users as friends.
- **DB/Login** - Store user information, friends, and ongoing game information in a database.
- **WebSocket** - As a player updates their score, it is broadcast to other players in the game.
